3. The created music charts can be updated (put) by the id value
4. The created charts can be deleted (delete) by id vlue.

# Why are we doing this?
As part of Assignment this project has been created.

# How I expected the challenge to go.
I thought of writing Js files can be easy, but as we have differnt functions, it took little longer than i expected, but it was good learning.

# What went well?
I was able to create number of music charts in the back end 
I was able to read, update and deltete the created records.

# What didn't go as planned?
I think it took longer than expected also i think i felt some of the constants are duplicated between Post and Update calls in the Js file.

# Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
 may be code can be cleaned a little bit and constans can be created globally instead of inside the each function
